## **Explanation**
This code uses the Gradio library and Hugging Face Transformers to create a simple interface for generating stories using various text-generation models. Let's break it down step by step:

### **Key Steps**

1.   **Importing Libraries:** 
*   We import the Gradio library (gradio as gr) to create the interface.
*   We also import the pipeline function from Hugging Face’s Transformers library. This pipeline will be used to generate text based on the user’s input.

2.   **Defining the generate_story Function:** This function takes two * 
*  **inputs:**
  *   title: The title of the story, provided by the user.
  *   model_name: The name of the model to be used for story generation, chosen by the user from a list of available models.
*  **Inside the function:**
  *   The text-generation model is loaded using the pipeline function from Hugging Face's Transformers.
  *   The story is generated using the selected model based on the input title. Parameters like max_length (maximum length of the generated story), no_repeat_ngram_size (to avoid repeating sequences of words), temperature (to control the randomness of the output), and top_p (to use nucleus sampling, keeping the top 95% probable tokens) are fixed.
*  The function returns the generated story as a string.
3. **Creating the Gradio Interface:** 
*  This part creates a Gradio interface with two inputs:
  *  A Textbox for the user to enter the story title.
  *  A Dropdown for the user to select the model to be used for story generation. It provides several model choices, including gpt2, gpt-neo, and llama.
*  The output is a Textbox where the generated story will be displayed.
*  The interface also includes a title (AI Story Generator) and a description explaining what the interface does.
4. **Launching the Interface:**
* Finally, the Gradio app is launched using the launch function, making the interface accessible. The share=True parameter creates a public URL, allowing others to use the app as well.
