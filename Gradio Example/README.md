## **Explanation**
In this code, we are using the Gradio library to create a simple web interface for users to select and view short stories from a predefined collection.

### **Key Steps**

1.   **Importing the Gradio Library:** which helps in creating user-friendly interfaces to interact with machine learning models or simple functions like the one in this code.
2.   **Defining a Dictionary of Stories:** Python dictionary where each key is the title of a story, and the value is the actual text of the story. We have four stories: "Friendship," "Adventure," "Success," and "Family."
3. **Creating the Story Selection Function:** we define a function get_story that takes the selected story title as input and returns the corresponding story from the stories dictionary.

4. **Building the Gradio Interface:**
This is where we build the Gradio interface:
*   fn=get_story: This tells Gradio which function to call when the user interacts with the interface.
*   inputs=gr.Dropdown: This creates a dropdown menu with options from the stories dictionary. The user can select a story title from this dropdown.
*   outputs=gr.Textbox: This creates a textbox where the selected story will be displayed.

5. **Launching the Interface:** Finally, the launch function starts the Gradio app, making the interface accessible. The share=True parameter generates a public URL so that others can access the interface as well.
